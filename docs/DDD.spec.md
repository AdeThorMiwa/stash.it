### Value Objects ^^^

Workflow -> Array[ExecutionStep]

Represents the sequential set of atomic `ExecutionSteps` required to fulfill the Intent.

#### ExecutionStep

A single, atomic unit of work guaranteed by the platform's infrastructure (e.g., a single on-chain transfer or API call).
This is a SAGA

- int               step_id
- Operation         operation

- WithdrawOp

#### ExecutionStatus

Enumerates the possible lifecycle states of the `ExecutableIntent`.

- Waiting
- Completed
- Failed

### Domain Services ^^^

#### ExecutionEngine

Manages the `ExecutableIntent` state machine. It orchestrates the sequence of `ExecutionSteps` and interacts with the `BlockchainBoundedContext` for infrastructure execution.

- start_execution[ExecutableIntent]
- execute_step[ExecutionStep]: emits[StepCompleted] <!-- or it can emit operation based event, e.g TransferOpCompleted-->

### Domain Events ^^^

#### IntentExecutionRequested [Inbound]

The Command fired by the `RulesEngine` that tells the `ExecutionEngine` to create and start a new `ExecutableIntent`.

- Uuid      action_id
- Uuid      stash_id
- Intent    intent

#### StepCompleted [Outbound]

Fired when a single `ExecutionStep` finishes successfully. Used internally by the `ExecutionEngine` to advance the `Workflow` to the next step.

## AutomationBoundedContext

This supporting context contains the specialized business logic services for scheduling and enforcing rules. It has no Aggregate Roots and operates on data from other contexts.

### Domain Services ^^^^

#### TriggerEngine

The scheduler service. It constantly checks `Temporal` and `Event` triggers defined in the `GovernanceActions`.

- run_schedules[]: emits[ActionReady] <!-- retrieve temporal actions, evaluate schedules, fire event if ready-->
- listen_for_event[]: emits[ActionReady]

#### RulesEngine

The "brain" of the system. It retrieves the `GovernanceRules`, fetches the `StashStateSnapshot` (via the ACL/Projection), evaluates the `SimplePredicate`, and commands the next step.

- evaluate_action[ActionReady,StashStateSnapshot]: emits[IntentExecutionRequested|RuleViolated]

### Domain Events ^^^^

ActionReady [Inbound|Outbound]

Fired by the `TriggerEngine` when a `Trigger` is successfully met. It signals the `RulesEngine` to begin evaluation of the corresponding `Intent`.

- Uuid      stash_id
- Intent    intent

IntentExecutionRequested [Outbound]

The command to begin execution.
